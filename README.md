# STM32-3Phase-PWM-Generator
An STM32-based system for generating three-phase PWM signals with sinusoidal duty cycles and a 2Ï€/3 phase shift. Features real-time duty cycle adjustment via a potentiometer, LCD display, and precise control using the STM32F411VE microcontroller. Ideal for motor control, power electronics, and embedded systems projects.
