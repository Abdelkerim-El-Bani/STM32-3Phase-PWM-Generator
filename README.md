# STM32-3Phase-PWM-Generator
This project is an **STM32-based 3-Phase PWM Generator** designed to generate three Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals with sinusoidal duty cycles and a **2Ï€/3 phase shift** between them. The system is built using the **STM32F411VE microcontroller** and features real-time control via a potentiometer, with duty cycle values displayed on a **16x2 LCD**.

This project was made in STM32CubeIDE 1.16.0
